## Description

This mod aims to improve your gameplay with [XP Storage](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/xp-storage) and
[Trinkets](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/trinkets-fabric), **both required** of course. In this 
extension, you can craft a new magic gem: **Cristalis Lazuli**. With this, you will be able to craft some Trinkets.

* **Cristalis Lazuli recipe:** 4 lapis lazuli (it's all about experience so lapis needed makes 
senses), and 1 amethyst shard (because it is meant to be a precious magic gem)
* **XP Conduit recipe/slots:** 3 copper ingots and 1 cristalis lazuli. The XP Conduit is a ring, so you can wear it in 
both mainhand and offhand ring slots
* **XP Saver recipe/slot:** 3 strings and 1 cristalis lazuli. The XP Saver is an amulet, so you can wear it in necklace 
slot
* **XP Conduit use:** When you wear it, 75% of the experience you get will automatically be transferred in XP Book(s) 
from your inventory. However, this has a cost: each experience transferred use your ring until your ring become fully 
damaged!
* **XP Saver use:** When you wear it, 50% of the experience you had before to die will automatically be transferred in 
XP Book(s) from your inventory. However, this has a huge cost: each death use your amulet and make it completely 
damaged!
* **Trinkets damaged**: Don't worry! These trinkets don't break, but you'll have to repair it with a new cristalis 
lazuli to be able to use their power again. Note that you can repair them even though they're not fully damaged
* **Mod configuration**: The mod is fully configurable: you can (de)activate only trinkets that you like. You also can 
change the amount (%) of experience that XP Conduit/Saver can transfer, and their durability
